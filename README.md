# Adventure-Works-Cycle-AW-Project---SQL-SSIS-SSAS-Project

## I. Project Description 
Adventure Works Cycle (AW) is a global manufacturer and retailer of bicycles and cycling 
equipment. Headquartered in the Netherlands, AW produces its brands of mountain, road, and 
touring bikes, which it sells through over 700 retail stores. It also directs internet sales to 
individual consumers. 
AW's product portfolio comprises 97 bike models segmented into three main categories. The 
company manufactures some components while purchasing parts, accessories, and apparel 
from over 100 outside suppliers, enabling AW to operate as both a bicycle manufacturer and a 
reseller of complementary cycling products. 
The core operational database contains 68 tables covering primary business functions, 
including sales, purchasing, production, HR, and contacts. It stores data on nearly 20,000 
people (employees, customers, vendor contacts) along with details on over 31,000 customer 
sales transactions and 4,000 purchasing records. 
As AW has proliferated, it now aims to leverage business intelligence to focus its resources 
and sustain this growth trajectory. A data warehouse will enable data-driven decisions to 
promote the optimal products to each customer segment. 
## II. Focus Area 
### Stakeholder: Marketing Department 
### Goal:
Target all sales and marketing promotions to the ‘most suitable’ customers who could 
enable AW to sustain and accelerate its growth. 
The marketing team needs granular intelligence on customer segments to enable tailored 
promotions and offerings. The data warehouse should empower answering questions, 
including: 
1. To understand their value, how to profile and categorize customers across dimensions 
like loyalty, profitability, frequency, location, and product preferences. 
2. Which customer segments have the highest growth potential and opportunity to guide 
strategy? 
3. Recommend target segments for customized sales and marketing initiatives based on 
potential value. 
4. Analyze how different loyalty tiers should impact customer treatment and engagement 
efforts. 
5. Determine the core factors driving profitability for customer segments to optimize. 
6. Differentiate retention approaches based on granular order frequency analysis. 
7. Enable communications and service personalization based on insights into each 
segment. 
8. Incorporate location-based purchasing behaviors into targeted marketing. 
9. Leverage product usage patterns for accurate customer segmentation and targeting. 

With these capabilities, marketing can execute highly personalized, high-impact campaigns 
tailored to the needs of each customer group for sustainable growth.
